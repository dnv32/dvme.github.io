    &lt;p&gt;Last week I finished a project that is a (delayed) birthday gift for Shiva, and she liked it (well, it was designed to her specifications :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made every mistake I could as a beginner-woodworker. Sloppy cuts happened all over the place and I had to sand everything extensively. Another problem was the choice of wrong joints - I used pocket hole screw with Kreg jig, with two screws per joint, and is not a very strong joint as it turned out. The filler in the corners of the shlef-vertical struts joints is cracking&amp;hellip; But from 1 meter away all the imperfections are not easy to see and that&amp;rsquo;s good for the first project!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
