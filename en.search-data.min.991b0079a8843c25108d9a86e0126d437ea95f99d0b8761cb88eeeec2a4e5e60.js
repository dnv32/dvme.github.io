Sloppy cuts happened all over the place and I had to sand everything extensively. Another problem was the choice of wrong joints - I used pocket hole screw with Kreg jig, with two screws per joint, and is not a very strong joint as it turned out. The filler in the corners of the shlef-vertical struts joints is cracking\u0026hellip; But from 1 meter away all the imperfections are not easy to see and that\u0026rsquo;s good for the first project!\n    Wood: red oak (1in (nom) S4S boards) Filler: natural wood filler (it\u0026rsquo;s really better to use read oak dust mixed with wood glue). Finish: Real Milk tung oil with citric acid solvent (smells so good!) Tools used: table saw, drill, impact driver, router, clamps, random orbit sander sand paper, brush.  Anyways, the process of creating something wooden is so special, I really get in the flow state easily. Sometimes frustration takes over, but that\u0026rsquo;s a good indicator for a breaktime, and getting back a bit aired out and relaxed keeps the gears spinning and work is getting done. I have to admit it took quite a bit longer to get it done as I expected, mostly not because of the work needed itself, but rather because of the messyness of the garage at the moment (it\u0026rsquo;s another work in progress thing..) and the other happenings of life.\nA lot of skills, knowledge and tools have been acquired in the process. Wait for the next project!\n"}),a.add({id:5,href:'/2020/12/moscow-russia/',title:"Moscow, Russia",section:"Trips",content:"Test test tes\n"}),a.add({id:6,href:'/2020/11/frasier-colorado/',title:"Frasier, Colorado",section:"Trips",content:""}),a.add({id:7,href:'/2020/10/our-lightweight-eyewear-work-is-summarized-in-a-paper-and-available-through-uist-2020-archive/',title:"Our lightweight eyewear work is summarized in a paper and available through UIST 2020 archive!",section:"Blog",content:"This post briefly summarizes the work I\u0026rsquo;ve done while at Google Research, around 2018-2019 timeframe.\nWearable Subtitles: Augmenting Spoken Communication with Lightweight Eyewear for All-day Captioning #  Extended video overview of the completed work:   UIST 2020 Entry "}),a.add({id:8,href:'/2020/09/south-lake-tahoe-california/',title:"South Lake Tahoe, California",section:"Trips",content:""}),a.add({id:9,href:'/2020/09/multiple-input-multiple-output-switch-aka-mimosa-went-open-source/',title:"Multiple Input Multiple Output Switch aka MIMOSA went open source!",section:"Blog",content:"MIMOSA is designed to be the most versatile user interface for wide veriety of applications.
